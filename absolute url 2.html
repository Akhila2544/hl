<p><q>Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession fro  m the past, through the present, into the future.</q>It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. <blockquote>Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.</blockquote></p>

<p style="color: blueviolet;font-size: 25px;font-style:oblique;text-align:center;" ><q>Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars</q><blockquote>Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.</blockquote></p>

<p> <blockquote>Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities.</blockquote>The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. <q>Time is used to define other quantities, such as velocity, so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition</q></p>
